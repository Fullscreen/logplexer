# Logplexer - Multiplex all the logs

Logplexer allows you to multiplex where your logs go depending on the environment: either standard out, log file or Honeybadger. This can be configured at initialize-time or runtime.

By default in a Rails app, it is set to log to standard out in `development` and `test` and log to Honeybadger in any other environment. As log as you have Honeybadger set up in your application this gem will work.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'logplexer', github: "Fullscreen/logplexer"
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

## Usage

Logplexer is a wrapper for `Honeybadger.notify` or Ruby's `Logger` class with all the methods for the typical `Logger` class.

If you are in `development`, you can write:

```ruby
> Logplexer.info( Exception.new("Oh hai!") )
I, [2015-06-20T15:25:02.182916 #23463]  INFO -- : Oh hai!
=> nil
```

Or in `production`:

```ruby
> Logplexer.info( Exception.new("Oh hai!") )
=> "684f15d9-c8f6-4ad8-885d-3ee50f612305"
```

Which will call `Honeybadger.notify()`

Inputs can be any type, `Exception`, `String`, `Hash`, etc.

If you are in development and would like to log to a logfile, just specify a logfile in the opts argument like so:

```ruby
> Logplexer.info( "Oh hai!", { logfile: '/Users/ryanc/Desktop/log.txt'} )
 => true
```

```bash
cat ~/Desktop/log.txt
# Logfile created on 2015-06-20 15:49:16 -0700 by logger.rb/47272
I, [2015-06-20T15:49:16.040351 #23538]  INFO -- : Oh hai!
```

If you would like to see the whole backtrace, just set `verbose` to true like so:

```ruby
def method1
  begin
    raise "Holy errors Batman"
  rescue => e
    Logplexer.error( e, { verbose: true} )
  end
end

def method2
  method1
end

def method3
  method2
end

method3
```

```
E, [2015-06-21T16:04:59.247900 #25737] ERROR -- : Holy errors Batman
E, [2015-06-21T16:04:59.248003 #25737] ERROR -- : > /Users/ryanc/Workspace/test_logplexer/config/initializers/logplexer.rb:6:in `method1'
E, [2015-06-21T16:04:59.248024 #25737] ERROR -- : > /Users/ryanc/Workspace/test_logplexer/config/initializers/logplexer.rb:13:in `method2'
E, [2015-06-21T16:04:59.248041 #25737] ERROR -- : > /Users/ryanc/Workspace/test_logplexer/config/initializers/logplexer.rb:17:in `method3'
```

Or if you are in developmet and would like to have all instances of Logplexer be verbose, just set the environment variable `LOG_VERBOSE` to "true" like so:

    ENV["LOG_VERBOSE"] = "true"

and everything that isn't specifically marked as `verbose: false` will print the backtrace. Keep in mind that verbose only works when the input is an Exception type.

## Configuration

If your `RAILS_ENV` is set to `development` or `test`, Logplexer will set an environment variable called `LOG_TO_HB` as "false" if it is anything else, i.e. `production` or `staging`, `LOG_TO_HB` will be set to "true".

Overriding this behavior is as easy as adding an initializer with the line:

    ENV['LOG_TO_HB'] = "true"

or

    ENV['LOG_TO_HB'] = "false"

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake rspec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
